Build with command 'make'. It requires CaDiCaL (at least version 1.6) and looks
for 'libcadical.a' and 'cadical.hpp' in the cadical subfolder, update both
CADICAL_INC and CADICAL_LIB_DIR in the 'makefile' to the folders where these
files are located.

The program expects two input files:
-cnf: DIMACS file generated by py-qsm.
-pic: orbit info file generated by py-qsm.

To try it out, run the following command:

./build/qsm -cnf ./test/i4-lock-server-s2-c2.cnf -pic ./test/i4-lock-server-s2-c2_qcosts.txt 


To generate the necessary cnf and pic files, see the options --print-dimacs and
--print-classinfo of py-qsm/minimizer.py.
Note that to print this information, the py-qsm minimizer does not have to be
able to finish minimization. The CNF encoding and the quantified costs are just
the inputs of the minimization problem.
